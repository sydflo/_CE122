/*
DATA TYPES


int - integer -32 bits (1s or 0s)- 4 bytes
short - a smaller data type allows for more memory -32,768 - 32,767 - 2 bytes
long long - really by integer type - 8 bytes


float - decimal number - 4 byte
double - decimal - 8 byte

8 bits to a byte and each bit is a binary digit (0,1)

hexadecimal numbers using digits 0....9,8,A,B,C,D,E,F

bool - boolean variables (True, False) stored as (1,0)- 1 byte

char - characters. use 1 byte ADCII characters- american standard code for information interchange- letters associated with numbers
